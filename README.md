Example code to be read alongside https://blog.lucify.com/building-interactive-visualizations-with-react-d3-and-typescript-206c7172b0d2.

**Note:** the code is in this repository is meant to show how React, Redux and
D3 can be used together in a scalable way for complex interactive
visualizations. If all you want to do is show a single bar chart, a much simpler
architecture should be used.
