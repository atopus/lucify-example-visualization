# An example visualization app built with React, Redux, D3 and TypeScript

Example code to be read alongside [TODO].

**Note:** the code is in this repository is meant to show how React, Redux and
D3 can be used together in a scalable way for complex interactive
visualizations. If all you want to do is show a single bar chart, a much simpler
architecture should be used.

## Development

Set up the development environment with:
```shell
yarn
